# Solving Inverse Problems with Deep Learning - Autumn School

The autumn school aims to provide an introduction into solving inverse problems with deep learning methods. A background to classical inverse problems theory and reconstruction methods will be discussed and possible shortcomings. We will discuss how deep learning can be used to formulate a learned reconstruction operator to alleviate some of these shortcomings. A special emphasis is made on robustness and mathematical guarantees of the learned reconstructions. 

# Lecturer and topics: 
Simon Arridge (UCL):			        Inverse Problems theory

Carola-Bibiane Sch√∂nlieb (U. Cambridge): 	Variational methods and learned reconstructions

Andreas Hauptmann (U. Oulu): 		      Deep Learning basics and learned reconstruction operators

Jonas Latz (U. Manchester): 			        Statistical Learning and Bayesian Inverse Problems
