# Solving Inverse Problems with Deep Learning - Autumn School

The autumn school aims to provide an introduction into solving inverse problems with deep learning methods. A background to classical inverse problems theory and reconstruction methods will be discussed and possible shortcomings. We will discuss how deep learning can be used to formulate a learned reconstruction operator to alleviate some of these shortcomings. A special emphasis is made on robustness and mathematical guarantees of the learned reconstructions.
